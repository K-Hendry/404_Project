        <p id="p1">Our dog park was built by
            Kelsey Hendry and Han Khuong as a part of a
            larger project to show appreciation to
            adorable doggos. Shiba Land has done amazing
            work with the city and nonprofit partners to
            not only improve our lives by building the
            ultimate place for puppies, but also to
            construct a nicely designed website for our
            Web Design class.</p>
        <p id="p2">Visitors will definitely find
            themselves lost in a feeling of wholesomeness
            as they walk, bike or ride horses through this
            undisputed gem of Philadelphiaâ€™s park system.</p>
