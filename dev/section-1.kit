    <div id="paragraph1"><p>Our dog park was built by 
        Kelsey Hendry and Han Khuong as a part of a 
        larger project to show appreciation to 
        adorable doggos. Shiba Land has done amazing 
        work with the city and nonprofit partners to 
        not only improve our lives by building the 
        ultimate place for puppies, but also to 
        construct a nicely designed website for our 
        Web Design class.</p></div>
    <div id="paragraph2"><p>Visitors will definitely find 
        themselves lost in a feeling of wholesomeness 
        as they walk, bike or ride horses through this 
        undisputed gem of Philadelphiaâ€™s park system.</p>
