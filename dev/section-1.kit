                <p id="p1">Our dog park was built by
                    Kelsey Hendry and Han Khuong as a part of a
                    larger project to show appreciation to
                    adorable doggos. Shiba Land has done amazing
                    work with the city and nonprofit partners to
                    not only improve our lives by building the
                    ultimate place for puppies, but also to
                    construct a nicely designed website for our
                    Web Design class.</p>
                <p id="p2">Visitors will definitely find
                    themselves lost in a feeling of wholesomeness
                    as they walk, bike or ride horses through this
                    undisputed gem of Philadelphiaâ€™s park system.</p>
